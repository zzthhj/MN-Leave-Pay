# Privacy Policy for MN Leave Pay

**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

### 1. Overview
Your privacy is our priority. **MN Leave Pay** ("the App") is designed to be 100% offline and private. We do not collect, store, or share your personal financial or health-related data.
**In short: What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.**

### 2. Data Collection and Storage

**2.1 Local Storage Only**
All data you enter into the App is stored strictly locally on your device using Apple's secure storage technologies (SwiftData and UserDefaults). This includes:
* Your average weekly wage and estimated benefit amounts.
* Your leave usage history (Medical, Bonding, and Family Care).
* Your application checklist status.
* Your app settings.

We (the developer) have absolutely no access to this data. We do not host any servers, and your data is never uploaded to any cloud database owned by us.

**2.2 Data Ownership**
You maintain full ownership and control of your financial data at all times. Since data is local, if you decide to reset the app or delete it, the data is removed from the device immediately.

### 3. No Tracking
* **No Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Firebase) to track your usage or financial inputs.
* **No Advertising:** The App does not contain any advertisements and does not share data with advertising networks.
* **No Account Required:** You do not need to create an account, sign in, or provide an email address to use the App.

### 4. Data Retention
Since we do not host any servers, we do not retain your data. Your data exists only on your device.
* **Deletion:** If you delete the App from your device, all your local data (including wage inputs and leave history) will be deleted immediately and permanently.

### 5. Disclaimer
This App is a calculation utility designed for **Minnesota employees**. While we strive for accuracy regarding **MN Statutes Chapter 268B** (Paid Family and Medical Leave), the calculations are estimates for informational purposes only and do not constitute professional legal, financial, or government advice. This app is not affiliated with the MN Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED).
